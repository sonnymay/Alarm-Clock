# Alarm-Clock

This project is a simple alarm clock built using Python. The script takes an hour and minute input from the user and plays a sound at the specified time to wake the user up. This can be handy if you need a custom alarm for any reason, or if you're just looking to experiment and learn Python scripting.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `https://github.com/sonnymay/alarm-clock.git`.
   
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sonnymay/alarm-clock.git
   cd alarm-clock
   ```

2. No additional dependencies are required, as the script uses Pythonâ€™s standard library.

### Usage

1. Run the script.

    ```shell
    python alarm_clock.py
    ```

2. When prompted, enter the hour (in 24-hour format) and minute when you want the alarm to go off.

3. The script will play a sound at the specified time.

> Note: The sound playing function is platform-specific. The default script is configured for Windows. If you're on macOS or Linux, you need to replace the sound playing part with a platform-specific method.
